The blow came down from the hills
Followed by snow
Ohhh ohh
The snowy blow

I could feel far off the glow
And i made my way through
September and the next, month
Towards the glow

I moved slow
Down from the hills
I'm getting cold
Buried in snow

(Hey wake up it's me the glow
Wake up and listen close
Warm up and come down through the hills
Towards the warm red lamp window)

I started to glow!
Ohh oh
And it felt just like
Being pulled out by the tide
I held on to your sides
We swam 'til it got light
Cause the blue was deep and wide

Into light our bodies glide
There was water in my eyes
We sank and we arrived
And found ourselves inside the light
The light
With the glow...

On the cold dark ocean floor
I felt warmth from behind a door
I asked to come inside
And the glow replied
