I just popped a fake xan, I'm feelin' fake high
Heard your man can do both, he a wack guy and a fake guy
I just copped some new clothes, you know I stay fly
Ask me where my squad at, bet I brought 'em here on FaceTime
Baby, fuck with me because she like how I'm ready to die
And I fuck with her, she paint my nails while we drinkin' red wine
I put a tattoo up on her thigh and she said she'd be mine
Yeah, I'm out my mind but you can see the shine

I'ma glo yeah, I'ma glo
My soul full of holes yeah, but you know I'ma glo
And, and when I hear them talkin'
Shit, I'm lovin' everything they say now
If you tryna fuck with me, you better run that PayPal
I glo yeah, I'ma glo
My soul full of holes yeah, but you know I'ma glo
And when I open my requests it's
Just like "Lil Death, how you do that?
'Cause I'm capricorn, that mean the goat, I thought you knew that

And when I open my requests it's
Just like "Lil Death, how you do that?
Because I'm capricorn, the goat

I just sipped some fake lean, I'm feelin' fake shlumped
Versace might be on me but you know that I stay punk
'Cause I don give a fuck, no, I do what I wanna
I ain't got no llama, but you miss me with that drama
Yeah, I see them talking, but I don't pay no mind to no haters
I been dead a long time, only way get me up with a seance
Lookin' at me weird but they love how I'm saucin' and swaggin'
I don't mean to brag, but you know I get that bag

I'ma glo yeah, I'ma glo
My soul full of holes yeah, but you know I'ma glo
And, and when I hear them talkin'
Shit, I'm lovin' everything they say now
If you tryna fuck with me, you better run that PayPal
I glo yeah, I'ma glo
My soul full of holes yeah, but you know I'ma glo
