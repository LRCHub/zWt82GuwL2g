Out of all context and scenery
It shows laughter is inside of me
Aching paths dont cross so easily
Break my back to see things differently

So glow
We've held off the cold
Low and behold
The seasons passing too

I find reasons and stop wondering
The different ways in which we feel the same
Give to much to.?
Now the second time means more to me

So glow
We've held off the cold
So glow
We've held off the cold
Low and behold
Turns winter spring and fall
