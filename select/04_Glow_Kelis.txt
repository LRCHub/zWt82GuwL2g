There's a wild streak in me,
But its only for you to see,
Look to my heart,
Cause you know i'm ready to start,
I guess i'm trying to say,
Yes i've been waiting for this very day,
Hope you're going too slow,
Cause we're about to the sun a-glow

How do we make it, i do know,
If there was ever a problem it had to go
Sometimes it's kinda hard, yes i do agree
See 1 plus you just equals me,
Now just watch us glow, now just watch us glow

Now in love something crazed,
Exude from your eyes when they are fixed on me
And like the eternal flame,
We have a fire that won't ever stop burning
There's a power in numbers baby,
But 2 is deemed the perfect team
Me and you equals 2
We will battle the masses baby, but we will claim the victory

How do we make it, i do know,
If there was ever a problem it had to go
Sometimes it's kinda hard, yes i do agree
See 1 plus you just equals me,
Now just watch us glow, now just watch us glow

Some said we would never change,
Look at us now people tried to tear it all apart,
Boy you stole my heart so quickly

How do we make it, i do know,
If there was ever a problem it had to go
Sometimes it's kinda hard, yes i do agree
See 1 plus you just equals me,
Now just watch us glow, now just watch us glow

How do we make it, i do know,
If there was ever a problem it had to go
Sometimes it's kinda hard, yes i do agree
See 1 plus you just equals me,
Now just watch us glow, now just watch us glow
